Zen time is eternal NOW.

But you can also read approximate mental time by detecting position of zen-circle (hour) and dot around this circle (minute).
In screenshots it is a 11:00, 6:45, 3:30. 

To feel presence better you can set auto-vibrate interval (10-60 min). 

This face can also detect a watch status by displaying words:
- "silence" on quiet time,
- "void" on low battery,
- "freedom" when connection lost,
- "power" on charging.

Additionaly it has a extrimely power saving mode (refreshing only central part of screen once at 5 minutes).

You can continue live in stress. Always be in a standby mode and every time check a watch. 
But there is another way. The Event model. And Pebble provide full set of features for it.

Zen Time watchface philosophy:
- Live in a continuous NOW.
- Don't track a time.
- If you plan events - make an early reminder in a calendar/alarm and don't wait it.
- If you want to see a date - install "Today is" app in a top. Press middle button.
steps - press Up button.
weather - move Weather app in a top. Press middle button.
battery level - move Settings in a top. Press middle button.
- Use timers in everyday life.
- Install "Breathe" or "Respire" app to make a better practice.
